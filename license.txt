AssemblyNet SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

Disclaimer
This Agreement is a free software license resulting from a discussion between its authors and economic rights holder to define the principles governing the distribution of the AssemblyNet software and the extended rights conferred to users. This Agreement also aims at designating an applicable law: the French law, to which it complies, both regarding civil liability law and intellectual property law and the protection it offers to the authors and holder of economic rights on a software.

Preamble
This Agreement is a free software license whose purpose is to give users the freedom to use the software governed by this license.
The exercising of this freedom is conditional upon an obligation to not reproduce, modify, redistribute and/or make commercial use of the software.
In consideration of access to the source code granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the softwareâ€™s author, the holder of the economic rights and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
In this respect, the user's attention is drawn to the risks associated with the loading and use of the software by the user, given its Free Software status, which may make it complex to handle and therefore reserves it for developers or informed professionals with in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore invited to load and test the suitability of the software for their needs under conditions that ensure the security of their systems and/or data and, more generally, to use and operate it under the same security conditions. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and distributed, provided it is not altered, without adding or deleting any clauses.

This Agreement may apply to any software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.
